## 📊 Model Performance

The XGBoost model achieved strong predictive performance on the equipment failure dataset.

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score

The model was further optimized using threshold tuning to improve failure detection while maintaining a good balance between precision and recall.
